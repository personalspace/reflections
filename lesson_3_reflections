When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you were collaborating with others or when you are working on a project from multiple locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that you do not pull a change into your local directory that modifies what you are working on.
