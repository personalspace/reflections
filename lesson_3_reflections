When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you were collaborating with others or when you are working on a project from multiple locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that you do not pull a change into your local directory that modifies what you are working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
The difference between forks and clones are that forks exist on the GitHub server and clones can exist there or in a local directory. A branch is a version of a file that has been modified and can exist with an unmodified or differently modified version of the file.
