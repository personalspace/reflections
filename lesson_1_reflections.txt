What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like in Google docs does?
You may forget to commit and loose your changes but you are in control of when the changes are saved. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because of what the vcs' were designed to be used for, ie. coding vs. documents.

How can you use the commands, git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log shows you the changes that have been committed and git diff allows you to compare the code within the commits.

You can always revert to a previous version that works.
